# TaskPlanner Android App

TaskPlanner is a minimal, to-do list manager for Android built with Unity. It helps you stay organized with both timed and non-timed tasks, recurring tasks, and a clean interface for managing your day. It's a simple productivity tool I've designed for my own use, with plans for expansion.
